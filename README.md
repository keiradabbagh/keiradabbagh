# 👋Hi,I'm Keira Dabbagh

## About Me
I'm a **junior studying Computer Science at Columbia Engineering**.

- I have strong interests in **AI, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision**.
- I’m passionate about the **intersection of creativity and problem-solving**, and I enjoy exploring spaces like **fashion × technology**.
- I’m especially interested in work where **technical rigor meets design, product intuition, and user experience**.
- Beyond pure engineering, I enjoy thinking about the **product, strategy, and go-to-market side of building technology** — what to build, why it matters, and how it reaches users.
- I like collaborating on **ambitious, thoughtful projects** and building things that feel both technically solid and creatively meaningful.
