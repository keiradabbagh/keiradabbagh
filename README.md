# 👋 Hi,I'm Keira Dabbagh

## About Me
I'm a **junior studying Computer Science at Columbia Engineering**.

- 🤖 I have strong interests in AI, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision.
- 🎨 I’m passionate about the intersection of creativity and problem-solving, and I enjoy exploring spaces like fashion × tech.
- 🧠 I’m especially interested in building products that are technically strong while still being well-designed and intuitive to use.
- 🚀 Beyond pure engineering, I enjoy thinking about the product, strategy, and go-to-market side of building technology.
- 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on cool ML projects!
